It comprises of circa 15,000 hectares of Atlantic blanket bog and mountainous terrain, covering a vast uninhabited and unspoilt wilderness dominated by the Nephin Beg mountain range. To the west of the mountains is the Owenduff bog. This is one of the last intact active blanket bog systems in Ireland and Western Europe and is an important scientific and scenic feature of the National Park. Wild Nephin National Park is part of the Natura 2000 Network, which protects rare and important habitats and species under the EU Habitats and Birds Directive.
